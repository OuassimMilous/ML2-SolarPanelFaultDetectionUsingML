# Solar Panel Fault Detection via Drone-Captured Images

## Overview

This project automates the fault detection process in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems using drone-captured thermal images. By leveraging machine learning models, the goal is to identify defective modules based on temperature anomalies captured by infrared cameras.

## Problem Statement

Solar PV systems are prone to module failures due to operational stresses and installation errors. Traditional inspection methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project addresses these challenges by developing a machine learning pipeline to analyze drone-captured thermal images and identify defective modules efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of:
- **Thermal (IR) images**: Captured by drones.
- **Annotations**: Marking the corners and centers of each PV module and labeling them as "defective" or "non-defective."

### Challenges
- **Imbalanced Data**: Few examples of faulty modules compared to non-faulty ones.
- **Limited Thermal Data**: Addressed using feature extraction techniques.

## Features Extracted
- **Temperature Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, maximum, and range.
- **Distribution Metrics**: Skewness and kurtosis.
- **Fault Detection**: Labels from annotations indicating module condition.

## Tested Machine Learning Models
The following models were tested:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
5. **Logistic Regression**


### Evaluation Metric
Due to the imbalanced dataset, the **F1-Score** was chosen as the primary evaluation metric, ensuring a balance between precision and recall.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Each model was optimized using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation. The best parameters for each model were:
